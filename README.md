# UART-Protocol-

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) protocol.

# Features
Full-duplex communication.

Configurable baud rate, data bits(5-8) and stop bits(1-2).

FIFO-based transmit and receive buffers.

#Files
README.md: This file, containing information about the project.

transmitter_test/: Folder containing Verilog testbenches to validate the transmitter module.

receiver_test/: Folder containing Verilog testbenches to validate the receiver module.


# Testing
The receiver_test and transmitter_test folders contain Verilog testbenches to validate the functionality of the transmitter and receiver modules, respectively. Simulation can be performed using a Verilog simulator such as QuestaSim or ModelSim.
